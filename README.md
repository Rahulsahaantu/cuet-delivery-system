# CUET Delivery System

This project is a simple MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) prototype for a peer-to-peer delivery system for CUET students.

## Backend

The backend is a minimal Express server located at `index.js`. It responds with a welcome message at the root route.

Run it with:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Frontend

The `client` directory contains a lightweight React frontend built without a bundler. Open `client/public/index.html` in a browser to try it out. The interface lets students post delivery requests which show up in a list.
